        <h2 class="section-title">What I'm Doing Now</h2>
        <p>
          I currently work as a <strong>Technical Solutions &amp; Partnerships Lead</strong> at
          <a href="https://www.fugumobile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Fugumobile
          </a>, representing the company across the UK and Europe.
          I partner with clients to translate business needs into software solutions—working closely
          with engineering teams in China to scope, design, and deliver digital products from proposal
          through implementation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in Jakarta and grew up in Shanghai before moving to the UK for university, an experience that shaped a global perspective and a high level of
           adaptability from an early age. Being exposed to different cultures, education systems, and ways of thinking encouraged independence, curiosity, and
           clear communication — qualities that now influence how I approach complex technical problems and collaborative engineering work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I studied Computer Science with High Performance Graphics and Games Engineering at the University of Leeds (BSc/MEng), where I focused on real-time 
          rendering, low-level graphics programming, and performance-critical systems. My interests lie in graphics pipelines, engine 
          architecture, and game development with an emphasis on understanding systems from first principles rather than treating them as black boxes.
        </p>
